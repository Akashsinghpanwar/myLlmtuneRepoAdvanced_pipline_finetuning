      "question": "How do Axess HR ER probes compensate for changes in electrical resistance due to factors like temperature?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "Answer must mention the reference element, its material, its location inside the probe, and its function in compensating for temperature changes. Incorrect answers may omit one or more of these details.",
      "answer": "Axess HR ER probes utilize a second element, called the reference element, which is manufactured from the same material as the measurement element. The reference element is stored inside the body of the probe, where it is shielded from the process and used to auto-compensate for changes in electrical resistance due to other factors such as temperature.",
