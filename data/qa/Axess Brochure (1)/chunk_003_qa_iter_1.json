The answer must also mention the preference for low stroke volume and high stroke frequency.",
      "answer": "Using an atomiser in a gas system can help with fine volume control by adjusting the injection differential pressure and maintaining a constant application of the chemical. Chemicals injected using an open quill are applied in a pulse method with the frequency determined by the stroke rate of the chemical injection pump.
