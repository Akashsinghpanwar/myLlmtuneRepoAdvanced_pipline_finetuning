      "question": "What causes an Axess retrieval tool to piston?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "The answer must include the following:\n- Retrieval tools are designed for pressure balance.\n- Equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids.\n- Lack of equalization can cause pistoning.",
      "answer": "Retrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.",

      "question": "What are the dangers associated with using non-telescoping retrieval tools?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "The answer must include the following:\n- Non-telescoping tools have external handles that can whip violently.\n- Whipping occurs when pressure surges and the plug unseats without equalization.\n- These tools have been linked to increased operator injuries in the past 10 years.",
      "answer": "Non-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years.",
