      "question": "What causes an Axess retrieval tool to piston?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "The answer must include the following:\n- Retrieval tools are designed for pressure balance.\n- Equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids.\n- Lack of equalization can cause pistoning.",
      "answer": "Retrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.",
