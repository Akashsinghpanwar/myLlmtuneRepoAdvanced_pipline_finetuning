      "question": "Explain how the design of the Axess Horizon access fitting ensures a full penetration weld after hot-tapping.",
      "evaluation_criteria": "Answer correctly explains that the partial bore allows for hot-tapping, the 'metal backed' root ensures a secure weld initially, and its removal during hot-tapping leads to a full penetration weld.",
      "answer": "The Horizon fitting is partially bored through from the opposite end so it can be hot-tapped following installation. This design provides a 'metal backed' root which is then removed post- welding during hot-tapping to provide a full penetration weld.",
