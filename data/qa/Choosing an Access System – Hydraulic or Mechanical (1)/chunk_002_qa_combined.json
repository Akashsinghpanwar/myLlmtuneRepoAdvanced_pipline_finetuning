      "question": "Why is servicing of hydraulic access fittings generally a longer process compared to mechanical systems, according to Axess Corrosion?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "Correctly identifies the reasons for longer hydraulic fitting servicing: leak path interfaces (6 vs 2), mechanical threads (5 vs 3), and pressurization time.",
      "answer": "Hydraulic access fitting servicing generally takes longer than mechanical systems due to more leak path interfaces to check/seals to renew (6 vs 2), more mechanical threads to inspect (5 vs 3), and the longer pressurization of the hydraulic action of the tool.",
