      "question": "What is the difference in the number of potential leak paths between mechanical and hydraulic access fittings?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "Counts the number of leak paths for each fitting type.  Incorrect answers may miscount the number of leak paths or confuse the fitting types.",
      "answer": "Mechanical fittings have 1 potential leak path (the seals on the plug), while hydraulic systems have 5 potential leak paths (4 locking pins and the plug).",

      "answer": "Plug seal failure in mechanical fittings can be contained by a pressure retaining cover, but failure of pin seals in hydraulic systems cannot be contained by the cover.",
