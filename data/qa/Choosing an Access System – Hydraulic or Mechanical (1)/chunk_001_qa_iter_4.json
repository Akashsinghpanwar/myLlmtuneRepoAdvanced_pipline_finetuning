      "question": "According to Axess Corrosion, what is the difference in the number and location of potential leak paths between mechanical and hydraulic access fittings?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "Counts the leak paths for each system correctly. Mentions the location of the leak paths (plug seals for mechanical, locking pins and plug for hydraulic).",
      "answer": "Mechanical fittings have 1 potential leak path at the plug seals, while hydraulic systems have 5 potential leak paths at the 4 locking pins and the plug.",

      "question": "What are the causes of galling in mechanical versus hydraulic access fittings, according to Axess Corrosion?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "Identifies the causes of galling for both mechanical (poor material, sand ingress) and hydraulic (locking pins) systems.",
      "answer": "Mechanical fittings have historically galled due to poor material selection and ingress of sand, while hydraulic systems can experience galling with the 4 external locking pins.",

      "question": "How does using the Axess 'Saturn' coupon holders reduce the risk of corrosion and galling, and prolong seal life, according to Axess Corrosion?",
      "evaluation_criteria": "Lists all three benefits: reduced galling risk, reduced corrosion, and prolonged seal life due to reduced abrasive particle ingress.",
      "answer": "Using the Axess 'Saturn' coupon holders reduces the risk of galling, reduces corrosion inside the access fitting body, and prolongs seal life by reducing the risk of ingress of abrasive particles that could damage seals and sealing surfaces.",
