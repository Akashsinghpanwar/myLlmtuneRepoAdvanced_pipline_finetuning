AXHP & AXHPH Access Systems
Below are some major points of consideration when selecting the access fitting system.
1.Safety - Leak Paths
Mechanical fittings have 1 potential leak path, this is the seals on the plug. Plug seal failure can be contained by a pressure retaining cover.
The hydraulic system has 5 potential leak paths, these are the 4 locking pins and the plug. Failure of pin seals cannot be contained by the cover.

2. Safety - Galling
Where mechanical fittings have galled historically, this has been due to poor material selection and ingress of sand etc.
On the hydraulic system, the galling can occur with the 4 external locking pins. This can be avoided during materials selection and the latest 2-Piece Hydraulic access system further prevents this from being a risk. In the past, locking pins may have to be drilled out which can lead to integrity issues with the fitting and the pipeline.
Positive pressure balancing techniques can be used to eliminate this scenario on mechanical fittings.
Mechanical Solid Plug

The latest Axess 'Saturn' coupon holders (shown on the left) sweep the access fitting of debris during installation and prevent debris from entering the fittings whilst the monitoring device is installed.
This will reduce the risk of galling, reduce corrosion inside the access fitting body and prolong seal life by reducing the risk of ingress of abrasive particles that could damage seals and sealing surfaces.
3. Logistics - Equipment Selection
Currently all mechanical equipment available on the market is Interchangeable, consequently, spares are readily available, and prices are very competitive.

Choosing An Access Fitting System
4. Time Saving - Servicing
Servicing of hydraulic fittings is generally accepted as being a longer process than the mechanical system. There are more leak path interfaces to check / seals to renew (6 against 2), more mechanical threads to inspect (5 against 3) and the pressurization of the hydraulic action of the tool can be a much longer process. To make the job site safe, it can be much faster with mechanical.
5. Pressure Rating
Mechanical and hydraulic access fittings can both be rated to 10'000psi and above, but the mechanical tools are only rated to 6000psi. We can offer hydraulic tools at 10,000psi.
