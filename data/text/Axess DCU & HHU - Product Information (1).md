High Resolution Multi Function
The Axess DCU is a high resolution, battery powered, corrosion monitoring instrument capable of reading all types of electrical resistance (ER), linear polarization resistance (LPR) and galvanic probes.
The unit is operated with an integrated menu driven screen for ease of use, providing rapid measurements of metal loss for electrical resistance probes, corrosion rate for linear polarization resistance probes, and current or potential for galvanic probes. The most recent reading is also viewable on the display.
Up to 7,200 data points are preserved in the internal memory which can be downloaded to the Axess HHU via the RS-232 Serial ASCII connection, for transfer to the accompanying corrosion monitoring software (CDAS) for analysis. The software is used to graph metal loss trends, calculate corrosion rates with data exportable in csv (comma separated value) format for import into excel and other applications.
The GRP enclosure is lightweight and an optional mounting bracket kit is available for direct mounting to site structure or Axess low and high pressure access systems.
