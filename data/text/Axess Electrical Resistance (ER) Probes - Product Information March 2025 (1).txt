ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE (ER) PROBES
ER Technique & Configuration
Early detection of changes in corrosion is key to implementing and optimizing a robust corrosion control program. The Axess range of HR ER probes are designed and compatible with High Resolution Instrumentation providing a highly sensitive method of detecting corrosion and erosion events by monitoring small changes in the electrical resistance of a metal element directly exposed to the process.
The use of HR ER (electrical resistance) probes is a proven, established industry technique which operates on the principle that the electrical resistance of a metal element will increase as the cross-sectional area decreases due to corrosion or erosion. Axess HR ER probes utilize a second element, called the reference element. Manufactured from the same material as the measurement element, the reference element is stored inside the body of the probe, where it is shielded from the process and used to auto-compensate for changes in electrical resistance due to other factors such as temperature.
Unlike some other technologies, Axess HR ER probes operate independently of the process properties and can therefore be used in almost any environment.

Where to Monitor What to Monitor
Axess offers ER probes in a variety of configurations to suit almost all monitoring locations and processes. Tubular element probes are more robust, have longer lifespans and are ideally suited to monitoring center of line. Flush probes can be installed with the element positioned in line with the pipe wall and are therefore suited to monitoring top and bottom of the line where localized corrosion may occur. Multiple mounting options are offered for both high- and low- pressure systems with many of these being retrievable for maintenance and replacement under normal operating conditions using Axess retrieval equipment.

Incorporating Axess HR ER probes and High-Resolution instrumentation into an integrity management program provides early, reliable detection of changes in corrosion/erosion rates allowing operators, integrity, and maintenance teams to optimize corrosion control programs, increase safety and extend asset life.
The Axess online dashboard allows you set multiple thresholds for alarms that will send you email or SMS alerts, enabling you to monitor by exception.

Underground ER Probes
Model ERUG corrosion probes are designed for heavy duty service conditions such as underground and structural monitoring of pipelines, vessels, above and below ground storage tanks and structures, whether cathodically protected or not.
The surface strip element assembly is suited to the "construction site" environment.
The cylindrical element is economical and durable. Its slim profile is convenient for locations with restricted access such as concrete bridge structures and other infrastructure applications.
Both probes provide good sealing of the reference element. The check element provides reliability in the continued performance of the corrosion sensor.
Either probe may be connected to a cathodically protected structure using the attached grounding lead.
This allows the probe to measure the effectiveness of the Cathodic Protection (C.P.) System under operating conditions.
If left unconnected from the structure, the probe monitors the direct corrosivity of the soil or environment.
The grounding lead is installed at the connector end, unless otherwise specified. This enables connection to the C.P. System to be made as required even after probe installation.
Available in Cylindrical and Surface Strip Element from 10mil element thickness to 40mil on the Surface Strip and 10mil to 50mil thickness on the cylindrical option.
Standard cable lengths of 10-20feet. Longer lengths available upon request.
Consult with Axess Corrosion for additional information.
