Introduction\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the steps required to install a Horizon Access Fitting onto a pipe. Welding should be carried out in accordance with site specific procedures.\n\n2. Horizon Access Fitting\n\nThe Axess Horizon access fitting is designed to provide bottom of the line corrosion monitoring with all the safety and operational advantages of a side of the line access fitting.\nThe Horizon fitting is supplied with one end contoured to the size of pipe it is to be installed onto and is partially bored through from the opposite end so it can be hot-tapped following installation as shown by the fitting in the middle below. This design provides a 'metal backed' root which is then removed post- welding during hot-tapping to provide a full penetration weld.\nCORROSION/AR WOJJECT HORIZONS STATES PATER OFFICE US -186617 A3500627\nTo install onto the pipe hold the contoured end of the Horizon fitting directly against the pipe surface and orientate until the length of the fitting is aligned horizontally:\nAxess 22632 Kuykendahl Rd\nSpring, TX 77389 USA\nwww.axess.energy\nAXESS\nTack weld the Horizon fitting at several spots around the circumference of the mating face to secure in place then proceed to weld to the pipe by layering several beads around the circumference of the end profile:\nAfter the fitting has been welded to the pipe the end profile nearest the pipe can then be hot-tapped using an Axess supplied hot-tap tool and accompanying temporary service valve:\nService Valve\nHORIZON\nAXESS\nScott\nHop\nHot Tap Tool\nAxess 22632 Kuykendahl Rd\nSpring, TX 77389 USA\nwww.axess.energy\nAXESS\nThe weld metal backing and root are removed during the hot tapping process leaving a full penetration weld.\nPipe internal post hot tapping\nAxess 22632 Kuykendahl Rd Spring, TX 77389 USA\nwww.axess.energy\nAXESS\nFollowing hot tapping the service valve is closed, the hot-tap tool pressure bled down and removed and a retrieval tool can then be used to install the monitoring device. An online ER probe with instrument is shown below with the ER probe element located in the water phase.\nIn instances where the monitoring device is to be installed at a later date the access fitting can be sealed with a solid plug and secondary pressure retaining cover until required:\nAxess 22632 Kuykendahl Rd\nSpring, TX 77389 USA\nwww.axess.energy"}
