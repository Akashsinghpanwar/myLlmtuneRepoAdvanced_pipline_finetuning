Choosing An Access Fitting System

4. Time Saving - Servicing

Servicing of hydraulic fittings is generally accepted as being a longer process than the mechanical system. There are more leak path interfaces to check / seals to renew (6 against 2), more mechanical threads to inspect (5 against 3) and the pressurization of the hydraulic action of the tool can be a much longer process. To make the job site safe, it can be much faster with mechanical.

5. Pressure Rating

Mechanical and hydraulic access fittings can both be rated to 10'000psi and above, but the mechanical tools are only rated to 6000psi. We can offer hydraulic tools at 10,000psi.
