Plug seal failure can be contained by a pressure retaining cover.\nThe hydraulic system has 5 potential leak paths, these are the 4 locking pins and the plug. Failure of pin seals cannot be contained by the cover.\nMechanical Access Fitting\nAXESS\nHydraulic Access Fitting\nCONSIDERATION POINTS\nSAFETY: LEAK PATHS\nSAFETY: RISK OF GALLING\nLOGISTICS\nSAVING TIME\nPRESSURE RATING\nChoosing An Access Fitting System\n\n2. Safety - Galling\n\nWhere mechanical fittings have galled historically, this has been due to poor material selection and ingress of sand etc.\nOn the hydraulic system, the galling can occur with the 4 external locking pins. This can be avoided during materials selection and the latest 2-Piece Hydraulic access system further prevents this from being a risk. In the past, locking pins may have to be drilled out which can lead to integrity issues with the fitting and the pipeline.\nPositive pressure balancing techniques can be used to eliminate this scenario on mechanical fittings.\nMechanical Solid Plug\nHydraulic Solid Plug\nThe latest Axess 'Saturn' coupon holders (shown on the left) sweep the access fitting of debris during installation and prevent debris from entering the fittings whilst the monitoring device is installed.\nThis will reduce the risk of galling, reduce corrosion inside the access fitting body and prolong seal life by reducing the risk of ingress of abrasive particles that could damage seals and sealing surfaces.\n\n3. Logistics - Equipment Selection\n\nCurrently all mechanical equipment available on the market is Interchangeable, consequently, spares are readily available, and prices are very competitive.\nAXESS CORROSION\nInnovating Safety ...\nJANUSGUARD\n\n2001 Timberloch Place, Suite 500, The Woodlands Texas 77380, USA, www.axess-corrosion.com, +1 (832) 990 6754_info@axess-corrosion.com WhatsApp"}

Time Saving - Servicing\n\nServicing of hydraulic fittings is generally accepted as being a longer process than the mechanical system. There are more leak path interfaces to check / seals to renew (6 against 2), more mechanical threads to inspect (5 against 3) and the pressurization of the hydraulic action of the tool can be a much longer process. To make the job site safe, it can be much faster with mechanical.\n\n5. Pressure Rating\n\nMechanical and hydraulic access fittings can both be rated to 10'000psi and above, but the mechanical tools are only rated to 6000psi. We can offer hydraulic tools at 10,000psi.\nAXESS CORROSION\nInnovating Safety ...\nJANUSGUARD\n\n2001 Timberloch Place, Suite 500, The Woodlands Texas 77380, USA, www.axess-corrosion.com, +1 (832) 990 6754_info@axess-corrosion.com WhatsApp\n\nChoosing An Access Fitting System\nExample Retrieval Assemblies\nMECHANICAL RETRIEVAL\nHYDRAULIC RETRIEVAL\nPUMP\n2\nRETRIEVER\nSERVICE VALVE\nAXES\nAXES\nACCESS FITTING\nPIPE\nAXESS CORROSION\nInnovating Safety ...\nJANUSGUARD\n\n2001 Timberloch Place, Suite 500, The Woodlands Texas 77380, USA, www.axess-corrosion.com, +1 (832) 990 6754_info@axess-corrosion.com WhatsApp"}
