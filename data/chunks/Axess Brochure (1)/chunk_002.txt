About Axess
Corrosion & Erosion
There are many factors to consider when selecting suitable locations for the installation of Corrosion and Erosion monitoring points.
Pipe geometry, flow conditions and process fluid can all influence the occurrence and the development rate of corrosion and erosion within a facility as well as effecting the rate at which chemicals mix and disperse within the process.
Corrosion monitoring points can be located downstream of any process change including branch connections where additional process streams are introduced, and at the end of the line to ensure that chemicals are still effective throughout the piping system.
Erosion is a risk at higher velocities such as downstream of the choke, particularly where the presence of sand has been detected previously or may be suspected/expected. Other areas at high risk for erosion may include locations with rapid changes in direction such as small radius bends, and T-sections.
