Other areas at high risk for erosion may include locations with rapid changes in direction such as small radius bends, and T-sections.\nFlow Lines ER (Corrosion) / ER (Erosion) Coupons / Non-Intrusive (Erosion) / Biofilm\nSeparator Vessels ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons\nKO Drums ER / Non-Intrusive / Hydrogen\nProduct Water / Injection ER / LPR / Galvanic Non-Intrusive / Biofilm\nDrain Lines ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons\nWater Injection ER / LPR / Galvanic Non-Intrusive / Biofilm\nGlycol Units ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons Compression ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons Flare Lines ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons\nExport Lines ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons\nwww.axess-corrosion.com\nIntrusive Monitoring Techniques\n\nAxess offers a full range of hardware for the insertion and retrieval of monitoring, injection and sampling devices.

Chemicals that are injected using an open quill are applied in a pulse method with the frequency determined by the stroke rate of the chemical injection pump. In most cases the preferred method is to have a low stroke volume with a high stroke frequency to minimise the time between each pulse injection of chemical.\nChemical injection points should always be located upstream of the equipment and pipework requiring protection.\nIn piping systems where there is a change of material (e.g. duplex at the well heads and carbon steel further down line), the injection point should ideally be located a minimum of 10 x pipe ID upstream of the change in material. The ideal injection location is normally centre line however for higher velocity processes, wake frequency / drag calculations should be considered to determine maximum length whilst maintaining the integrity of the injection device.\nwww.axess-corrosion.com\nImportant factors to consider\nChemical density and viscosity\n\nProcess pipe/vessel size, velocity, pressure, temperature, and fluid composition"}

We developed the Janus™ system to eliminate the life threatening problems with the original designs and in doing so we have introduced the first innovations in over half a century.\nWhat causes Retrieval Tool to piston?\nRetrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.\nWhat is the danger with Non-telescoping Retrievers?\nNon-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years. The risk is less obvious and a lack of knowledge and training on basic tool functionality has driven the misconception that non-telescoping tools are safer.\nSe\nthink you're\nsafe? think again ...\nJANUSGUARD\nJANUS QUARD\nThe risks with Back Pressure Tools\nBack pressuring provides benefits to the retrieval process, especially on bottom of the line fittings and so we do not aim to remove or replace this practice. The risks stem from equipment availability, calibration and the practicalities with using the equipment during every retrieval. Accurate pressure verification is critical and not always possible.\nWhat is the advantage of Janus™ Guard? The advantage is simple, the Janus™ Guard can save lives. It can do this by preventing retrieval tool barrels from pistoning, and handles from whipping, therefore removing the 'line of fire'.\nRetrieval tools have been in use for over 70 years. The design is relatively unchanged and until now there has been no innovation related to the tools or the access system itself. It's estimated that hundreds of online retrievals are performed every day without incident, yet many do lead to incidents and a number of those have led to fatalities.\nAll Axess retrieval tools are supplied with Janus™ technology and our innovations extend to Retrokit, Janus™ Service Valves and Access Fittings.\nFor more information about our Janus™ Guard product range, visit online at: www.axess-corrosion.com/janus\nDigital\nAxess instruments are designed to deliver your data in the simplest and most cost-effective method for your needs.\nOffline\nFor areas where basic historical information is good enough, data collection units are available. When the current metal loss or wall thickness value is all that is required, and monitoring is not, then spot measurement handheld units are also available.\nOnline\nMultiple communications options are available using industry standard protocols ranging from wired RS485 Modbus, 4-20mA, and HART to wireless protocols including WirelessHART/ISA100.\nFor remote locations we offer flexible cellular and satellite options and in instances where power is not available onsite these can be paired with energy harvesting options such as solar panels with battery backup to ensure uninterrupted, round the clock monitoring.\nData can be delivered from our range of instruments directly to your networked DCS, a cloud hosted dashboard with alarm settings for email and SMS notifications and GPS coordinates, or hosted by Axess and reported through a data subscription package.\nAxess Cloud Dashboard\nData\nData to Axess Cloud\nData to Cloud\nSiren Cellular Transmitter\nSiren Cellular Transmitter\nView Data on Axess Secure Dashboard via any Device with Internet Browser\nInjection Quill x 5\nSwarm Non-Intrusive Wall Thickness Monitors x 6\nER Probes x 2\nCorrosion Coupons x 2\nAXESS\nDEVICES\nMAP\nMANAGE\nto o alarms e\nCDO\nPYTHON 54-1-37-48\n--\n-\n-\n\n---\n\n0.0102 MILS\nOnline Monitors Enable Integrity Management by Exception\nDigital\nCoupon Retrievals\nInstalled for a period of time, usually changed out every 90 days, coupons are a basic form of monitoring and the correct handling of coupons ensures that the data you've been waiting for is not compromised. Retrieval work is more than adhering to work instructions. It demands that the tools are function tested and pressure certified, and that the operators value their role in delivering accurate and vital data.\nAXESS\nCoupon Analysis:\n0\n0\nAXESS -\nCC-15-610100AAAA\nModel No\nSerial No Weurt\nAAAH 37.2115#\nHval Code\nAXESS\nMoot Coom\n01230%\nAnalysis & Reporting\nAnalysis can include various measurements. Weight loss is the central measurement and the two methods of cleaning ensures very little metal loss occurs during that process. An average weight loss during cleaning is factored in to the final weights to improve accuracy of the data. White light and pit depth are measurement options as well as microbial data results from swabs taken immediately after coupon retrieval.\nField Services\nSite Surveys\nCapturing critical monitoring location data is paramount to a successful monitoring campaign. Fittings and seal materials should be captured to ensure that there is no potential for galling or seal failures. Device lengths and types assist with preparing the scope of work and information around orientation and process conditions all contribute to managing risk and ensuring the safe execution of the scope.\nAX\nKESS\nMonitoring Location:\nCC+1\nSidestream\nWhere there are no permanent access fittings in place the side stream offers a temporary monitoring solution ideal for chemical evaluation or optimization trials. Axess standard four cell manifold is designed to provide the ability to monitor with multiple sensor types and easily connect to process outlets or sample points. The units are customizable and portable. Standard options are rated to 1000psi and manifolds up to 10'000psi are available for well testing applications.\nField Services\nHot-tapping\nAxess provide the safest hot-tapping equipment designed for the online installation of both 1\" and 2\" access fittings. The Janus™ service valve kit provides a genuine double seal of the fitting connection and double isolation of the process. Available as twist drills or trepan cutters, the Axess hot-tap kit stands alone in it's versatility. The legacy carrier plug HTK is also supported and Axess supply the kits, cutters, spare parts and training.\nPlug & Abandon\nAn innovative solution to a growing problem enables engineers to remove \"Dead-leg\" from the conversation. As life extension of existing assets continue and intrusive monitoring fittings become unfit for purpose, there is a need for a cost-effective solution for making redundant welded access fittings safe and as free from future degradation as is possible. Axess patented design allows operators to purge the voids within the fittings and seal the cavities with corrosion resistant sealants.\nField Services\nTraining & Certification\nAxess provide the most complete training and certification programs for the safe use of online retrieval tools.\nOur third party certified trainers not only deliver safety awareness, but work with you through risk assessments and the competency management of trainees. We are your partner in ensuring your people have a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding before we begin the practical sessions. The training can be conducted using either hydraulic or mechanical retrieval tool kits and we can use single or double isolation valves. When using the mechanical equipment, Janus™ guards will be fitted to the retrievers and we can perform hundreds of retrievals on our custom flow loop at pressure up to 2000psi.\nU3-1270\nwww.axess-corrosion.com\nGreat to work with this team on all of our corrosion monitoring and chemical injection needs.
