One of the simplest ways to monitor your facility is with the use of corrosion coupons. The corrosion coupon is intrusively inserted into the process system and periodically removed to conduct weight loss and visual analysis.\nThe Axess AXHP range of coupon holders are designed for use with our AXHP access systems and allow the insertion and removal of corrosion coupons in pressurized piping systems up to 10,000psi. The coupon holders are installed through permanently mounted access fittings allowing installation and replacement of coupons without the requirement to isolate process pressure avoiding expensive isolation and shutdowns.\nCoupon holders are manufactured in 316SS material as standard and lengths are selected to suit the individual monitoring location.\nThe two main styles of coupon holder are 3\" strip and flush disc. Strip coupon holders can be used for monitoring at a pre-selected area within the pipe whilst flush disc coupon holders are ideal from monitoring inline with the pipe wall. Additional coupon holder types including ladder coupons and multidisc are available for specialist monitoring withing multiphase lines.\nMEET NACE MR0175 & MR0103 STANDARDS\nLOW COST MONITORING OPTION\nEASY INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE\nPROVIDES AVERAGE WEIGHT LOSS DATA\nPHYSICAL SPECIMEN TO IDENTIFY CORROSION MECHANISMS\nCoupon Holder Sizing\nOnce the access fitting type, and pipe dimensions are known, the style of holder and desired location of the coupons can be selected. The below formulas can then be used to position the coupons in the correct position within the line.\nUse the formulas below to calculate holder length. If calculated length is not an even 0.25\" increment, select next shortest to nearest 0.25\".\nTop of the Line Monitoring:\nCoupon holder positions the effective length of coupon into pipe vessel. (A + Pw + Wg) - 2.5\"\nMiddle of the Line Monitoring:\nCoupon holder positions '/2 of the coupon on either side of pipe centerline. (A + 1/2Pd+ Wg) - (2.5\" + 1/2EI)\nBottom of the Line Monitoring:\nCoupon holder positions coupon approximately '/.\" off bottom of line. (A + Pd + Wg) - (2.75\" + Pw + El)\nWhere:\nA = Length of Access fitting body Pw = Pipe wall (wall thickness of pipe) Pd = Pipe diameter (outside diameter of pipe) El = Effective length of coupon (the portion of the coupon exposed to the environment, i.e. 3\" coupon = 1-5/8\", 6\" coupon = 4-3/4\")\nWg = Weld gap (per weld procedures, 1/16\" is normal per ANSI B31.1 1973)\nAXESS CORROSION\nInnovating Safety ...\nJANUSGUARD\n\n2001 Timberloch Place, Suite 500, The Woodlands Texas 77380, USA, www.axess-corrosion.com, +1 (832) 990 6754_info@axess-corrosion.com WhatsApp"}
