Other areas at high risk for erosion may include locations with rapid changes in direction such as small radius bends, and T-sections.\nFlow Lines ER (Corrosion) / ER (Erosion) Coupons / Non-Intrusive (Erosion) / Biofilm\nSeparator Vessels ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons\nKO Drums ER / Non-Intrusive / Hydrogen\nProduct Water / Injection ER / LPR / Galvanic Non-Intrusive / Biofilm\nDrain Lines ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons\nWater Injection ER / LPR / Galvanic Non-Intrusive / Biofilm\nGlycol Units ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons Compression ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons Flare Lines ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons\nExport Lines ER / Non-Intrusive / Coupons\nwww.axess-corrosion.com\nIntrusive Monitoring Techniques\n\nAxess offers a full range of hardware for the insertion and retrieval of monitoring, injection and sampling devices.

We developed the Janus™ system to eliminate the life threatening problems with the original designs and in doing so we have introduced the first innovations in over half a century.\nWhat causes Retrieval Tool to piston?\nRetrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.\nWhat is the danger with Non-telescoping Retrievers?\nNon-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years. The risk is less obvious and a lack of knowledge and training on basic tool functionality has driven the misconception that non-telescoping tools are safer.\nSe\nthink you're\nsafe? think again ...\nJANUSGUARD\nJANUS QUARD\nThe risks with Back Pressure Tools\nBack pressuring provides benefits to the retrieval process, especially on bottom of the line fittings and so we do not aim to remove or replace this practice. The risks stem from equipment availability, calibration and the practicalities with using the equipment during every retrieval. Accurate pressure verification is critical and not always possible.\nWhat is the advantage of Janus™ Guard? The advantage is simple, the Janus™ Guard can save lives. It can do this by preventing retrieval tool barrels from pistoning, and handles from whipping, therefore removing the 'line of fire'.\nRetrieval tools have been in use for over 70 years. The design is relatively unchanged and until now there has been no innovation related to the tools or the access system itself. It's estimated that hundreds of online retrievals are performed every day without incident, yet many do lead to incidents and a number of those have led to fatalities.\nAll Axess retrieval tools are supplied with Janus™ technology and our innovations extend to Retrokit, Janus™ Service Valves and Access Fittings.\nFor more information about our Janus™ Guard product range, visit online at: www.axess-corrosion.com/janus\nDigital\nAxess instruments are designed to deliver your data in the simplest and most cost-effective method for your needs.\nOffline\nFor areas where basic historical information is good enough, data collection units are available.

An average weight loss during cleaning is factored in to the final weights to improve accuracy of the data. White light and pit depth are measurement options as well as microbial data results from swabs taken immediately after coupon retrieval.\nField Services\nSite Surveys\nCapturing critical monitoring location data is paramount to a successful monitoring campaign. Fittings and seal materials should be captured to ensure that there is no potential for galling or seal failures. Device lengths and types assist with preparing the scope of work and information around orientation and process conditions all contribute to managing risk and ensuring the safe execution of the scope.\nAX\nKESS\nMonitoring Location:\nCC+1\nSidestream\nWhere there are no permanent access fittings in place the side stream offers a temporary monitoring solution ideal for chemical evaluation or optimization trials. Axess standard four cell manifold is designed to provide the ability to monitor with multiple sensor types and easily connect to process outlets or sample points. The units are customizable and portable. Standard options are rated to 1000psi and manifolds up to 10'000psi are available for well testing applications.\nField Services\nHot-tapping\nAxess provide the safest hot-tapping equipment designed for the online installation of both 1\" and 2\" access fittings. The Janus™ service valve kit provides a genuine double seal of the fitting connection and double isolation of the process. Available as twist drills or trepan cutters, the Axess hot-tap kit stands alone in it's versatility. The legacy carrier plug HTK is also supported and Axess supply the kits, cutters, spare parts and training.\nPlug & Abandon\nAn innovative solution to a growing problem enables engineers to remove \"Dead-leg\" from the conversation. As life extension of existing assets continue and intrusive monitoring fittings become unfit for purpose, there is a need for a cost-effective solution for making redundant welded access fittings safe and as free from future degradation as is possible. Axess patented design allows operators to purge the voids within the fittings and seal the cavities with corrosion resistant sealants.\nField Services\nTraining & Certification\nAxess provide the most complete training and certification programs for the safe use of online retrieval tools.\nOur third party certified trainers not only deliver safety awareness, but work with you through risk assessments and the competency management of trainees. We are your partner in ensuring your people have a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding before we begin the practical sessions. The training can be conducted using either hydraulic or mechanical retrieval tool kits and we can use single or double isolation valves. When using the mechanical equipment, Janus™ guards will be fitted to the retrievers and we can perform hundreds of retrievals on our custom flow loop at pressure up to 2000psi.\nU3-1270\nwww.axess-corrosion.com\nGreat to work with this team on all of our corrosion monitoring and chemical injection needs.

Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.\nWhat is the danger with Non-telescoping Retrievers?\nNon-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years. The risk is less obvious and a lack of knowledge and training on basic tool functionality has driven the misconception that non-telescoping tools are safer.\nSe\nthink you're\nsafe? think again ...\nJANUSGUARD\nJANUS QUARD\nThe risks with Back Pressure Tools\nBack pressuring provides benefits to the retrieval process, especially on bottom of the line fittings and so we do not aim to remove or replace this practice.

We developed the Janus™ system to eliminate the life threatening problems with the original designs and in doing so we have introduced the first innovations in over half a century.\nWhat causes Retrieval Tool to piston?\nRetrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.\nWhat is the danger with Non-telescoping Retrievers?\nNon-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years. The risk is less obvious and a lack of knowledge and training on basic tool functionality has driven the misconception that non-telescoping tools are safer.\nSe\nthink you're\nsafe? think again ...\nJANUSGUARD\nJANUS QUARD\nThe risks with Back Pressure Tools\nBack pressuring provides benefits to the retrieval process, especially on bottom of the line fittings and so we do not aim to remove or replace this practice. The risks stem from equipment availability, calibration and the practicalities with using the equipment during every retrieval. Accurate pressure verification is critical and not always possible.\nWhat is the advantage of Janus™ Guard? The advantage is simple, the Janus™ Guard can save lives. It can do this by preventing retrieval tool barrels from pistoning, and handles from whipping, therefore removing the 'line of fire'.\nRetrieval tools have been in use for over 70 years. The design is relatively unchanged and until now there has been no innovation related to the tools or the access system itself. It's estimated that hundreds of online retrievals are performed every day without incident, yet many do lead to incidents and a number of those have led to fatalities.\nAll Axess retrieval tools are supplied with Janus™ technology and our innovations extend to Retrokit, Janus™ Service Valves and Access Fittings.\nFor more information about our Janus™ Guard product range, visit online at: www.axess-corrosion.com/janus\nDigital\nAxess instruments are designed to deliver your data in the simplest and most cost-effective method for your needs.\nOffline\nFor areas where basic historical information is good enough, data collection units are available.

We developed the Janus™ system to eliminate the life threatening problems with the original designs and in doing so we have introduced the first innovations in over half a century.\nWhat causes Retrieval Tool to piston?\nRetrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.\nWhat is the danger with Non-telescoping Retrievers?\nNon-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years. The risk is less obvious and a lack of knowledge and training on basic tool functionality has driven the misconception that non-telescoping tools are safer.\nSe\nthink you're\nsafe? think again ...\nJANUSGUARD\nJANUS QUARD\nThe risks with Back Pressure Tools\nBack pressuring provides benefits to the retrieval process, especially on bottom of the line fittings and so we do not aim to remove or replace this practice. The risks stem from equipment availability, calibration and the practicalities with using the equipment during every retrieval. Accurate pressure verification is critical and not always possible.\nWhat is the advantage of Janus™ Guard? The advantage is simple, the Janus™ Guard can save lives.

We developed the Janus™ system to eliminate the life threatening problems with the original designs and in doing so we have introduced the first innovations in over half a century.\nWhat causes Retrieval Tool to piston?\nRetrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.\nWhat is the danger with Non-telescoping Retrievers?\nNon-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years. The risk is less obvious and a lack of knowledge and training on basic tool functionality has driven the misconception that non-telescoping tools are safer.\nSe\nthink you're\nsafe? think again ...\nJANUSGUARD\nJANUS QUARD\nThe risks with Back Pressure Tools\nBack pressuring provides benefits to the retrieval process, especially on bottom of the line fittings and so we do not aim to remove or replace this practice. The risks stem from equipment availability, calibration and the practicalities with using the equipment during every retrieval. Accurate pressure verification is critical and not always possible.\nWhat is the advantage of Janus™ Guard? The advantage is simple, the Janus™ Guard can save lives. It can do this by preventing retrieval tool barrels from pistoning, and handles from whipping, therefore removing the 'line of fire'.\nRetrieval tools have been in use for over 70 years.

We developed the Janus™ system to eliminate the life threatening problems with the original designs and in doing so we have introduced the first innovations in over half a century.\nWhat causes Retrieval Tool to piston?\nRetrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.\nWhat is the danger with Non-telescoping Retrievers?\nNon-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years. The risk is less obvious and a lack of knowledge and training on basic tool functionality has driven the misconception that non-telescoping tools are safer.\nSe\nthink you're\nsafe? think again ...\nJANUSGUARD\nJANUS QUARD\nThe risks with Back Pressure Tools\nBack pressuring provides benefits to the retrieval process, especially on bottom of the line fittings and so we do not aim to remove or replace this practice. The risks stem from equipment availability, calibration and the practicalities with using the equipment during every retrieval. Accurate pressure verification is critical and not always possible.\nWhat is the advantage of Janus™ Guard? The advantage is simple, the Janus™ Guard can save lives. It can do this by preventing retrieval tool barrels from pistoning, and handles from whipping, therefore removing the 'line of fire'.\nRetrieval tools have been in use for over 70 years.

{"input": {"question": "What solutions does Axess provide for data delivery and power in remote monitoring locations?", "context": "Available installation ports and required clearance diameters\nIn general process piping applications, a minimum of 3-5 pipe diameters of straight length upstream and 5-10 pipe diameters of straight length downstream are recommended to ensure spray dispersion\nRequired materials of construction for corrosive environments\nEase of maintenance/replacement\nRetractable lances allow for quill/lance removal while leaving the process online\nRequired chemical flow rate\nPressure differential\nAvailability of steam, compressed air, nitrogen, or other carrier/atomization gases.\nAxess will help you specify the correct nozzle and ensure the devices supplied pass wake frequency / drag force calculations.\nChemical Injection & Sampling\nJanus' TM\nReduce Risk\nAxess retrieval tools, service valves and fittings are the safest in the business. We developed the Janus™ system to eliminate the life threatening problems with the original designs and in doing so we have introduced the first innovations in over half a century.\nWhat causes Retrieval Tool to piston?\nRetrieval tools are designed for pressure balance between the tool and the process. Equalization can be achieved through the carrier plug design, but over time the equalization ports can be blocked with scale or solids, especially at bottom of the line orientation. If equalization is not achieved prior to the disengagement of the carrier plug, there is a risk of pistoning.\nWhat is the danger with Non-telescoping Retrievers?\nNon-telescoping retrieval tools have external handles that can violently whip when pressure surges as the plug completely unseats from the fitting without pressure equalization. Recent research suggests this type of retriever has been responsible for an increase in operator injuries over the past 10 years. The risk is less obvious and a lack of knowledge and training on basic tool functionality has driven the misconception that non-telescoping tools are safer.\nSe\nthink you're\nsafe? think again ...\nJANUSGUARD\nJANUS QUARD\nThe risks with Back Pressure Tools\nBack pressuring provides benefits to the retrieval process, especially on bottom of the line fittings and so we do not aim to remove or replace this practice. The risks stem from equipment availability, calibration and the practicalities with using the equipment during every retrieval. Accurate pressure verification is critical and not always possible.\nWhat is the advantage of Janus™ Guard? The advantage is simple, the Janus™ Guard can save lives. It can do this by preventing retrieval tool barrels from pistoning, and handles from whipping, therefore removing the 'line of fire'.\nRetrieval tools have been in use for over 70 years. The design is relatively unchanged and until now there has been no innovation related to the tools or the access system itself. It's estimated that hundreds of online retrievals are performed every day without incident, yet many do lead to incidents and a number of those have led to fatalities.\nAll Axess retrieval tools are supplied with Janus™ technology and our innovations extend to Retrokit, Janus™ Service Valves and Access Fittings.\nFor more information about our Janus™ Guard product range, visit online at: www.axess-corrosion.com/janus\nDigital\nAxess instruments are designed to deliver your data in the simplest and most cost-effective method for your needs.\nOffline\nFor areas where basic historical information is good enough, data collection units are available. When the current metal loss or wall thickness value is all that is required, and monitoring is not, then spot measurement handheld units are also available.\nOnline\nMultiple communications options are available using industry standard protocols ranging from wired RS485 Modbus, 4-20mA, and HART to wireless protocols including WirelessHART/ISA100.\nFor remote locations we offer flexible cellular and satellite options and in instances where power is not available onsite these can be paired with energy harvesting options such as solar panels with battery backup to ensure uninterrupted, round the clock monitoring.\nData can be delivered from our range of instruments directly to your networked DCS, a cloud hosted dashboard with alarm settings for email and SMS notifications and GPS coordinates, or hosted by Axess and reported through a data subscription package.\nAxess Cloud Dashboard\nData\nData to Axess Cloud\nData to Cloud\nSiren Cellular Transmitter\nSiren Cellular Transmitter\nView Data on Axess Secure Dashboard via any Device with Internet Browser\nInjection Quill x 5\nSwarm Non-Intrusive Wall Thickness Monitors x 6\nER Probes x 2\nCorrosion Coupons x 2\nAXESS\nDEVICES\nMAP\nMANAGE\nto o alarms e\nCDO\nPYTHON 54-1-37-48\n--\n-\n-\n\n---\n\n0.0102 MILS\nOnline Monitors Enable Integrity Management by Exception\nDigital\nCoupon Retrievals\nInstalled for a period of time, usually changed out every 90 days, coupons are a basic form of monitoring and the correct handling of coupons ensures that the data you've been waiting for is not compromised. Retrieval work is more than adhering to work instructions. It demands that the tools are function tested and pressure certified, and that the operators value their role in delivering accurate and vital data.\nAXESS\nCoupon Analysis:\n0\n0\nAXESS -\nCC-15-610100AAAA\nModel No\nSerial No Weurt\nAAAH 37.2115#\nHval Code\nAXESS\nMoot Coom\n01230%\nAnalysis & Reporting\nAnalysis can include various measurements. Weight loss is the central measurement and the two methods of cleaning ensures very little metal loss occurs during that process. An average weight loss during cleaning is factored in to the final weights to improve accuracy of the data. White light and pit depth are measurement options as well as microbial data results from swabs taken immediately after coupon retrieval.\nField Services\nSite Surveys\nCapturing critical monitoring location data is paramount to a successful monitoring campaign. Fittings and seal materials should be captured to ensure that there is no potential for galling or seal failures. Device lengths and types assist with preparing the scope of work and information around orientation and process conditions all contribute to managing risk and ensuring the safe execution of the scope.\nAX\nKESS\nMonitoring Location:\nCC+1\nSidestream\nWhere there are no permanent access fittings in place the side stream offers a temporary monitoring solution ideal for chemical evaluation or optimization trials. Axess standard four cell manifold is designed to provide the ability to monitor with multiple sensor types and easily connect to process outlets or sample points. The units are customizable and portable. Standard options are rated to 1000psi and manifolds up to 10'000psi are available for well testing applications.\nField Services\nHot-tapping\nAxess provide the safest hot-tapping equipment designed for the online installation of both 1\" and 2\" access fittings. The Janus™ service valve kit provides a genuine double seal of the fitting connection and double isolation of the process. Available as twist drills or trepan cutters, the Axess hot-tap kit stands alone in it's versatility. The legacy carrier plug HTK is also supported and Axess supply the kits, cutters, spare parts and training.\nPlug & Abandon\nAn innovative solution to a growing problem enables engineers to remove \"Dead-leg\" from the conversation. As life extension of existing assets continue and intrusive monitoring fittings become unfit for purpose, there is a need for a cost-effective solution for making redundant welded access fittings safe and as free from future degradation as is possible. Axess patented design allows operators to purge the voids within the fittings and seal the cavities with corrosion resistant sealants.\nField Services\nTraining & Certification\nAxess provide the most complete training and certification programs for the safe use of online retrieval tools.\nOur third party certified trainers not only deliver safety awareness, but work with you through risk assessments and the competency management of trainees. We are your partner in ensuring your people have a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding before we begin the practical sessions. The training can be conducted using either hydraulic or mechanical retrieval tool kits and we can use single or double isolation valves.

Whilst many injection devices can only be serviced and maintained during shutdown conditions Axess provides a range of high and low pressure injection systems which can be serviced safely online at pressures up to 6,000 PSI / 413 Bar and temperatures up to 232°C / 450°F.\nRetrievable injection systems typically utilize a 2\" high pressure access fitting with integral side tee in a range of configurations including NPT, welded and flanged (see separate Axess datasheets).\nThe Axess Direct Injection system provides an alternate solution allowing the use of non-tee fittings whilst still maintaining the safety, reliability, and online servicing capability of our tee'd systems including secondary isolation with pressure retaining cover. These fittings provide the flexibility to repurpose existing monitoring fittings or allow installation of new injection points at critical locations where space may be restricted.\nIn addition, there are integrity management benefits with reduced side connections that may be threaded or welded.

The system allows insertion and retrieval of the devices under pressure, enabling monitoring to be maintained continuously without the need to shut down the process.\nAccess fittings are available in flareweld and flanged, mechanical and hydraulic versions and are manufactured in ASTM A105, ASTM A350 Gr.LF2 and Duplex steel as standard materials. However, other versions (e.g. HUB fittings) and materials are available upon request.\nDirect Injection Hollow Plug\nThe Hollow or Solid Plug provides the pressure seal in the access fitting and is the carrier for the corrosion monitoring device (probe or coupon holder). The primary packing is made from PTFE (15% glass filled) as standard but are available in a range of materials including metal seals for high temperature service.\nAxess plugs are available in 316 SS and Duplex as standard. Plug threads are coated and Axess experts can assist with material selection to reduce or eliminate galling risks.\nThe Direct Injection system uses a special version of the hollow plug incorporating two internal one way check valves. This allows chemical to be injected into the line through the center of the plug, and prevents flowback of process into the injection line.\nSpecial plug designs are available for high velocity applications based on results from wake frequency calculations. Please consult Axess for more information.\nInjection Devices Quills or Atomize\nAxess offers a range of injection tubes, quills, and nozzles to suit the injection method, rate and atomization required.\nInjection Options: the injection fluid can be drip fed or atomized, though atomization is only useful for injection into gas filled spaces or treating gas systems. Both methods of injection can be either top or middle of line, usually referred to as perpendicular and parallel (to line flow) injection, respectively. Top of line can be specified as flush for pigable lines.\nDrip Feed Tubes and Quills: for perpendicular drip feeds an open end tube is used. This method relies on the natural turbulence in the flow to disperse the chemical feed and may not be suitable when complete dispersal of a small volume of chemical is needed. Parallel injection uses a notched quill design at the center of the line which creates an artificial turbulence in the fluid flow to disperse the treatment chemical more effectively. The term quill is derived from the diagonally cut end of the tube which resembles a quill pen. As both designs may be used in fast fluid flows it is necessary to consider the strength and wake frequency of the design. Quill and tube diameters are otherwise selected to suit the rate of injection. Standard sizes range between 1/4\" and 3/4\".\nAtomizing Nozzles & Tubes: perpendicular atomizing nozzles are screwed into the end of an injection tube of the required length. Parallel nozzles require a tube with a mounting block holder. Nozzles are selected based on the desired injection flow rate by calculating the pressure differential (AP) between the pipe operating pressure and chemical injection pump pressure. The tube diameter must be capable of delivering the required flow and withstanding the system pressures and forces.\nReference\nJanus™ Retrieval Tools and Service Valves Axess Chemical Injection and Sampling Solutions\nCertification\nNACE MR0175 NORSOK and PED Compliance Upon Request\nAXESS CORROSION\nInnovating Safety ...\nJANUSGUARD\n\n2001 Timberloch Place, Suite 500, The Woodlands Texas 77380, USA, www.axess-corrosion.com, +1 (832) 990 6754_info@axess-corrosion.com WhatsApp"}, "output": "Axess Direct Injection systems can be serviced safely online at pressures up to 6,000 PSI / 413 Bar and temperatures up to 232°C / 450°F.", "meta": {"doc": "Axess Direct Injection Fittings - Product Information (1)", "chunk_id": 1, "category": "factual", "difficulty": 4}}

Please consult Axess for more information.\nInjection Devices Quills or Atomize\nAxess offers a range of injection tubes, quills, and nozzles to suit the injection method, rate and atomization required.\nInjection Options: the injection fluid can be drip fed or atomized, though atomization is only useful for injection into gas filled spaces or treating gas systems. Both methods of injection can be either top or middle of line, usually referred to as perpendicular and parallel (to line flow) injection, respectively. Top of line can be specified as flush for pigable lines.\nDrip Feed Tubes and Quills: for perpendicular drip feeds an open end tube is used. This method relies on the natural turbulence in the flow to disperse the chemical feed and may not be suitable when complete dispersal of a small volume of chemical is needed. Parallel injection uses a notched quill design at the center of the line which creates an artificial turbulence in the fluid flow to disperse the treatment chemical more effectively. The term quill is derived from the diagonally cut end of the tube which resembles a quill pen. As both designs may be used in fast fluid flows it is necessary to consider the strength and wake frequency of the design. Quill and tube diameters are otherwise selected to suit the rate of injection. Standard sizes range between 1/4\" and 3/4\".\nAtomizing Nozzles & Tubes: perpendicular atomizing nozzles are screwed into the end of an injection tube of the required length. Parallel nozzles require a tube with a mounting block holder. Nozzles are selected based on the desired injection flow rate by calculating the pressure differential (AP) between the pipe operating pressure and chemical injection pump pressure. The tube diameter must be capable of delivering the required flow and withstanding the system pressures and forces.\nReference\nJanus™ Retrieval Tools and Service Valves Axess Chemical Injection and Sampling Solutions\nCertification\nNACE MR0175 NORSOK and PED Compliance Upon Request\nAXESS CORROSION\nInnovating Safety ...\nJANUSGUARD\n\n2001 Timberloch Place, Suite 500, The Woodlands Texas 77380, USA, www.axess-corrosion.com, +1 (832) 990 6754_info@axess-corrosion.com WhatsApp"}, "output": "The primary packing in Axess plugs is made from PTFE (15% glass filled) as standard, but are available in a range of materials including metal seals for high temperature service.", "meta": {"doc": "Axess Direct Injection Fittings - Product Information (1)", "chunk_id": 1, "category": "factual", "difficulty": 5}}

The system allows insertion and retrieval of the devices under pressure, enabling monitoring to be maintained continuously without the need to shut down the process.\nAccess fittings are available in flareweld and flanged, mechanical and hydraulic versions and are manufactured in ASTM A105, ASTM A350 Gr.LF2 and Duplex steel as standard materials. However, other versions (e.g. HUB fittings) and materials are available upon request.\nDirect Injection Hollow Plug\nThe Hollow or Solid Plug provides the pressure seal in the access fitting and is the carrier for the corrosion monitoring device (probe or coupon holder). The primary packing is made from PTFE (15% glass filled) as standard but are available in a range of materials including metal seals for high temperature service.\nAxess plugs are available in 316 SS and Duplex as standard. Plug threads are coated and Axess experts can assist with material selection to reduce or eliminate galling risks.\nThe Direct Injection system uses a special version of the hollow plug incorporating two internal one way check valves. This allows chemical to be injected into the line through the center of the plug, and prevents flowback of process into the injection line.\nSpecial plug designs are available for high velocity applications based on results from wake frequency calculations. Please consult Axess for more information.\nInjection Devices Quills or Atomize\nAxess offers a range of injection tubes, quills, and nozzles to suit the injection method, rate and atomization required.\nInjection Options: the injection fluid can be drip fed or atomized, though atomization is only useful for injection into gas filled spaces or treating gas systems. Both methods of injection can be either top or middle of line, usually referred to as perpendicular and parallel (to line flow) injection, respectively. Top of line can be specified as flush for pigable lines.\nDrip Feed Tubes and Quills: for perpendicular drip feeds an open end tube is used. This method relies on the natural turbulence in the flow to disperse the chemical feed and may not be suitable when complete dispersal of a small volume of chemical is needed. Parallel injection uses a notched quill design at the center of the line which creates an artificial turbulence in the fluid flow to disperse the treatment chemical more effectively. The term quill is derived from the diagonally cut end of the tube which resembles a quill pen. As both designs may be used in fast fluid flows it is necessary to consider the strength and wake frequency of the design. Quill and tube diameters are otherwise selected to suit the rate of injection. Standard sizes range between 1/4\" and 3/4\".\nAtomizing Nozzles & Tubes: perpendicular atomizing nozzles are screwed into the end of an injection tube of the required length. Parallel nozzles require a tube with a mounting block holder. Nozzles are selected based on the desired injection flow rate by calculating the pressure differential (AP) between the pipe operating pressure and chemical injection pump pressure. The tube diameter must be capable of delivering the required flow and withstanding the system pressures and forces.\nReference\nJanus™ Retrieval Tools and Service Valves Axess Chemical Injection and Sampling Solutions\nCertification\nNACE MR0175 NORSOK and PED Compliance Upon Request\nAXESS CORROSION\nInnovating Safety ...\nJANUSGUARD\n\n2001 Timberloch Place, Suite 500, The Woodlands Texas 77380, USA, www.axess-corrosion.com, +1 (832) 990 6754_info@axess-corrosion.com WhatsApp"}, "output": "Axess Direct Injection fittings can repurpose existing monitoring fittings or allow installation of new injection points at critical locations where space may be restricted.", "meta": {"doc": "Axess Direct Injection Fittings - Product Information (1)", "chunk_id": 1, "category": "reasoning", "difficulty": 6}}

The system allows insertion and retrieval of the devices under pressure, enabling monitoring to be maintained continuously without the need to shut down the process.\nAccess fittings are available in flareweld and flanged, mechanical and hydraulic versions and are manufactured in ASTM A105, ASTM A350 Gr.LF2 and Duplex steel as standard materials. However, other versions (e.g. HUB fittings) and materials are available upon request.\nDirect Injection Hollow Plug\nThe Hollow or Solid Plug provides the pressure seal in the access fitting and is the carrier for the corrosion monitoring device (probe or coupon holder). The primary packing is made from PTFE (15% glass filled) as standard but are available in a range of materials including metal seals for high temperature service.\nAxess plugs are available in 316 SS and Duplex as standard. Plug threads are coated and Axess experts can assist with material selection to reduce or eliminate galling risks.\nThe Direct Injection system uses a special version of the hollow plug incorporating two internal one way check valves. This allows chemical to be injected into the line through the center of the plug, and prevents flowback of process into the injection line.\nSpecial plug designs are available for high velocity applications based on results from wake frequency calculations. Please consult Axess for more information.\nInjection Devices Quills or Atomize\nAxess offers a range of injection tubes, quills, and nozzles to suit the injection method, rate and atomization required.\nInjection Options: the injection fluid can be drip fed or atomized, though atomization is only useful for injection into gas filled spaces or treating gas systems. Both methods of injection can be either top or middle of line, usually referred to as perpendicular and parallel (to line flow) injection, respectively. Top of line can be specified as flush for pigable lines.\nDrip Feed Tubes and Quills: for perpendicular drip feeds an open end tube is used. This method relies on the natural turbulence in the flow to disperse the chemical feed and may not be suitable when complete dispersal of a small volume of chemical is needed. Parallel injection uses a notched quill design at the center of the line which creates an artificial turbulence in the fluid flow to disperse the treatment chemical more effectively. The term quill is derived from the diagonally cut end of the tube which resembles a quill pen. As both designs may be used in fast fluid flows it is necessary to consider the strength and wake frequency of the design. Quill and tube diameters are otherwise selected to suit the rate of injection. Standard sizes range between 1/4\" and 3/4\".\nAtomizing Nozzles & Tubes: perpendicular atomizing nozzles are screwed into the end of an injection tube of the required length. Parallel nozzles require a tube with a mounting block holder. Nozzles are selected based on the desired injection flow rate by calculating the pressure differential (AP) between the pipe operating pressure and chemical injection pump pressure. The tube diameter must be capable of delivering the required flow and withstanding the system pressures and forces.\nReference\nJanus™ Retrieval Tools and Service Valves Axess Chemical Injection and Sampling Solutions\nCertification\nNACE MR0175 NORSOK and PED Compliance Upon Request\nAXESS CORROSION\nInnovating Safety ...\nJANUSGUARD\n\n2001 Timberloch Place, Suite 500, The Woodlands Texas 77380, USA, www.axess-corrosion.com, +1 (832) 990 6754_info@axess-corrosion.com WhatsApp"}, "output": "The Axess Direct Injection system can be used at pressures up to 10,000 PSI / 689 BAR and temperatures up to 204℃ / 400°F.", "meta": {"doc": "Axess Direct Injection Fittings - Product Information (1)", "chunk_id": 1, "category": "factual", "difficulty": 4}}

Flush disc coupon holders are available with fixed length and also with adjustable length.\nLadder (Strip) Coupon Holder\nLadder coupons are strip coupons with 2\" nominal length. These are typically mounted at top, center and bottom of a pipe (inner bore diameter permitting). This allows monitoring corrosion rate across multiple fluid / gas phases within the process flow. The access fitting would normally be located at the top (12o'clock) of the pipe.\nMultiple (Multi) Disc Coupon Holder\nMultiple disc coupons are typically mounted at top, center and bottom of a pipe (inner bore diameter permitting). This allows monitoring corrosion rate across multiple fluid / gas phases within the process flow.

{"input": {"question": "Why is servicing of hydraulic access fittings generally a longer process compared to mechanical systems, according to Axess Corrosion?", "context": "Choosing An Access Fitting System\n\n4. Time Saving - Servicing\n\nServicing of hydraulic fittings is generally accepted as being a longer process than the mechanical system. There are more leak path interfaces to check / seals to renew (6 against 2), more mechanical threads to inspect (5 against 3) and the pressurization of the hydraulic action of the tool can be a much longer process.

The Janus guard product is one of a product line designed to reduce the risks associated with intrusive internal monitoring and chemical injection systems.\nAt the same event, Axess were approached by Aramco engineers and set with the challenge to design a system to satisfy an issue which exists throughout Aramco facilities both onshore and onshore, upstream, and downstream - access to the bottom 10-20% of the pipe without access to the 6 o'clock position for retrieval equipment.\nNew capital projects call out for T trap assemblies which are an integrity and piping engineers concern as well as being unrepresentative of the process conditions.

From a safety perspective we know most incidents (personal injury, galled threads, damaged tools) take place on fittings at the 6 o'clock position. Mechanical or Hydraulic, same issues due to them acting as traps for debris. Gravity plays its part, and we have the Janus guard to prevent retrievers from pistoning due sudden pressure equalization after thread disengagement of the plug in the fitting. Pits have also been notorious for gathering toxic gases which have led to corrosion monitoring technician fatalities over the years. For 12 o'clock monitoring the Horizon fitting reduce the risk of working at heights, manual handling, and all the human factoring. During the concept design we consulted design engineers and field technicians, and, in every case, they all preferred side entry access points and handling equipment at waist height rather than above head (which is true for 6 o'clock or 12 o'clock).\nBy using Horizon fittings, device lengths will be no longer than 8\", meaning shorter and lighter retrievers and an easily managed stock inventory of replacement probes and coupon holders. In most cases wake frequency issues can be a thing of the past as we no longer install from the top to monitor the bottom. Pigging operations can be carried out with reduced concern if flush pitch and adjust devices are installed.\nAbout Janus™ Access Fittings\nThe Janus access fitting is designed to enhance end user confidence by adding a secondary radial sealing surface to the access fitting. In doing so we can describe the sealing between the service valve and the access fitting as a double seal helping to prevent process entering the environment. A third sealing profile has been added below the threads which allows the pressure retaining cover to environmentally seal the external fitting threads and the sealing surfaces.\nThe Janus™ access fitting design applies to mechanical RC, ACME, Horizon, and Hydraulic fitting designs.

From a safety perspective we know most incidents (personal injury, galled threads, damaged tools) take place on fittings at the 6 o'clock position. Mechanical or Hydraulic, same issues due to them acting as traps for debris. Gravity plays its part, and we have the Janus guard to prevent retrievers from pistoning due sudden pressure equalization after thread disengagement of the plug in the fitting. Pits have also been notorious for gathering toxic gases which have led to corrosion monitoring technician fatalities over the years. For 12 o'clock monitoring the Horizon fitting reduce the risk of working at heights, manual handling, and all the human factoring. During the concept design we consulted design engineers and field technicians, and, in every case, they all preferred side entry access points and handling equipment at waist height rather than above head (which is true for 6 o'clock or 12 o'clock).\nBy using Horizon fittings, device lengths will be no longer than 8\", meaning shorter and lighter retrievers and an easily managed stock inventory of replacement probes and coupon holders. In most cases wake frequency issues can be a thing of the past as we no longer install from the top to monitor the bottom. Pigging operations can be carried out with reduced concern if flush pitch and adjust devices are installed.\nAbout Janus™ Access Fittings\nThe Janus access fitting is designed to enhance end user confidence by adding a secondary radial sealing surface to the access fitting. In doing so we can describe the sealing between the service valve and the access fitting as a double seal helping to prevent process entering the environment. A third sealing profile has been added below the threads which allows the pressure retaining cover to environmentally seal the external fitting threads and the sealing surfaces.\nThe Janus™ access fitting design applies to mechanical RC, ACME, Horizon, and Hydraulic fitting designs. A simple back-end conversion of the service valves allows for the benefit's to be realized and yet still functions with legacy fittings. Axess recommend the Janus™ fitting for all new applications.\nThe retrieval process remains the same and the carrier plugs are no different from the conventional, but risk is greatly reduced.\nAxess is working with several major operators as well as AMPP and the Energy Institute to develop the Janus™ access fittings and retrievers as a standard best practice as we drive to deliver innovation to the internal corrosion monitoring industry.\nInitial field installation is taking place during May 2024 and Aramco will assess the change in their data due to more representative monitoring using the Horizon access fitting.\nWatch Video Overview\nHORIZON"}, "output": "The Janus guard prevents retrievers from pistoning due sudden pressure equalization after thread disengagement of the plug in the fitting.", "meta": {"doc": "Horizon Technolgy Overview  (1)", "chunk_id": 2, "category": "reasoning", "difficulty": 6}}
