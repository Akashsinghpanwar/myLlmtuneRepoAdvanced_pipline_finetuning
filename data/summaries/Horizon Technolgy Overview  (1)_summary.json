  "abstract": "The document is a technology overview of Horizon Access Fittings by Axess Corrosion Control. It discusses the Horizon system as an alternative to T trap assemblies for internal monitoring and chemical injection systems, highlighting cost savings, safety improvements, and more representative monitoring. The Janus access fitting is also introduced as a means to enhance end user confidence.",
  "key_points": [
    "Axess was awarded an innovation of the year award for our Janus Guard product designed to make online retrieval safer.",
    "Axess were approached by Aramco engineers and set with the challenge to design a system to satisfy an issue which exists throughout Aramco facilities both onshore and onshore, upstream, and downstream - access to the bottom 10-20% of the pipe without access to the 6 o'clock position for retrieval equipment.",
    "The number of flanged connections and valves and the materials spec itself means we recently reduced a project cost on access fittings alone by 85% through offering A105/LF2 Horizon fittings in place of 1500# RJ flanged fitting in 825.",
    "Cost Comparison: 300 x $1400 = $420,000. 12 Weeks",
    "Cost Comparison: 300 x $9166.35 = $2,749,905. 28 Weeks",
    "For 12 o'clock monitoring the Horizon fitting reduce the risk of working at heights, manual handling, and all the human factoring.",
    "By using Horizon fittings, device lengths will be no longer than 8\", meaning shorter and lighter retrievers and an easily managed stock inventory of replacement probes and coupon holders.",
    "Initial field installation is taking place during May 2024 and Aramco will assess the change in their data due to more representative monitoring using the Horizon access fitting."
