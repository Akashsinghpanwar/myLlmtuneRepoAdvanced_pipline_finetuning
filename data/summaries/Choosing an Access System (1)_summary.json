  "abstract": "A comparison of hydraulic and mechanical access systems, focusing on safety, logistics, time saving, and pressure rating.",
  "key_points": [
    "Mechanical fittings have one potential leak path; the hydraulic system has 5 (4 locking pins and the plug).",
    "Mechanical fittings galling can be due to poor material selection and ingress of sand etc.",
    "Positive pressure balancing techniques can be used to eliminate galling on mechanical fittings.",
    "The latest Axess ‘Saturn’ coupon holders sweep the access fitting of debris during installation.",
    "Hydraulic system galling can occur with the 4 external locking pins.",
    "Servicing of hydraulic fittings is generally accepted as being a longer process than the mechanical system.",
    "Mechanical and hydraulic access fittings can both be rated to 10’000psi and above, but the mechanical tools are only rated to 6000psi.",
    "We can offer hydraulic tools at 10,000psi."
