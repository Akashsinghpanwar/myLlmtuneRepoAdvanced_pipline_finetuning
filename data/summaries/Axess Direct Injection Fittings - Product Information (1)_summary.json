  "abstract": "The Axess Direct Injection system allows the use of non-tee fittings while maintaining safety, reliability, and online servicing capability. It is ideal for restricted access, eliminates integrity concerns with side tee connections, and offers significant cost savings. The system is pressure rated up to 10,000 PSI / 689 BAR and temperatures up to 204℃ / 400°F.",
