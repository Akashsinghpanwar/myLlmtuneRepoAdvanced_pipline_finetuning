Touch Football Australia (TFA) undertook an extensive internal review of their 
domestic playing rules throughout 2018 and 2019. The review was led by 
an vastly experienced group of current and past players, coaches, referees 
and administrators of the sport from community competitions to the elite 
international game. This group consulted broadly within the Australian 
community to develop a set of playing rules that could be applied across all 
levels of the sport. 
The result was the TFA 8th Edition Playing Rules. 
At the Federation of International Touch Paris Convention held in October 
2019 Touch Football Australia presented the TFA 8th Edition Playing Rules and 
subsequently offered FIT and all National Touch Associations (NTAs) royalty 
free rights to use the newly developed rules. 
Consequently, the FIT Board resolved to adopt the TFA 8th Edition Playing Rules 
as the 5th Edition FIT Playing Rules to be used across all levels of the game 
internationally. FIT and its Members acknowledge and thank Touch Football 
Australia for the rights to use these rules.
Whilst consistency in the application of the rules of the game is important, FIT 
encourages its members to offer features in local competition rules to ensure 
that all participants enjoy a high quality experience. These Rules in no way 
restrict any NTA or their authorised competition providers from having different 
match conditions to these Rules. Any adaptation of or alterations to the Rules 
for local competitions should be clearly articulated in relevant competition 
guidelines and be readily available for players, coaches and referees alikePreamble
